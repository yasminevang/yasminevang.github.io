# Hello, I'm Yasmine

Surprise! I am actually not a native New Yorker although I definitely think I look like I fit in. If you've noticed I say "y'all"... then pretend you don't. I am studying Biostatistics at Columbia, and I hope to go into psychiatric clinical trial work.

## Recent Updates
- I am dressing up as a French person for Halloween
- The Louvre robbery was an inside job. Had to be.
